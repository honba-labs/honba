"""Integration test suite to verify DuckDB fundamental data against official audited corporate reports.

Verifies:
1. Ground Truth / Golden Benchmarks: Cross-checks blue-chip fundamentals (TCS, Reliance, Britannia)
   against audited annual filings from BSE/NSE.
2. Accounting Invariants: Validates that fundamental data adheres to GAAP/IndAS accounting identities:
   - Capital Employed = Total Assets - Current Liabilities
   - ROCE % = (EBIT / Capital Employed) * 100
   - ROE % = (Net Income / Stockholders Equity) * 100
   - Operating Margin % = (EBIT / Revenue) * 100
   - Debt to Equity = Total Debt / Stockholders Equity
3. Data Integrity & Completeness across all 250 Large-Cap and Mid-Cap companies in DuckDB.
