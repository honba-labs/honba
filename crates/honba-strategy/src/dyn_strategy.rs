/// A type-erased [`Strategy`], delegating every hook to the boxed strategy.
///
/// [`StrategyRunner`](crate::StrategyRunner) and
/// [`StrategyAdapter`](crate::StrategyAdapter) are generic over the strategy
/// they wrap, which is what a single backtest wants: the engine hands out
/// `Box<dyn Handler>` and each handler is its own concrete type. A sweep is
/// different — it holds a *list* of trials, each with its own strategy, before
/// any of them is run, so the list has to be one type. This is that type.
///
/// Every hook delegates, including [`Strategy::on_start`] and
/// [`Strategy::on_stop`]: a hook that silently did nothing would silently
/// change the behaviour of a boxed strategy, which is exactly the bug a
/// type-erasing wrapper is prone to. Errors propagate unchanged, so a strategy
/// that fails inside a sweep fails the same way it would on its own.
