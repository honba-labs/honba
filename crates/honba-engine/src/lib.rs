//! Event kernel for the Honba trading platform.
//!
//! The kernel is deliberately small: a monotonic [`Clock`], a time-ordered
//! [`EventQueue`], a [`Handler`] trait, and an [`Engine`] that drives them.
//! Data sources and execution exchanges are injected via the [`DataFeed`] and
//! [`ExecutionEngine`] traits, so the same kernel runs backtests, paper
//! trading, and live sessions without code changes.
//!
//! A handler answers every event with an [`EngineOutput`] — orders to submit,
//! orders to cancel, or a new [`TradingState`] — and the engine is what
//! applies it: it routes the commands to the attached [`ExecutionEngine`],
//! turns fills back into [`Event::OrderFilled`](honba_messages::Event::OrderFilled)
//! messages, and appends what it did to an [`AuditLog`].
