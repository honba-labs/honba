//! Concurrent parameter sweeps for the Honba platform.
//!
//! A sweep runs many parameter sets over one shared dataset and scores each of
//! them, which makes it the only part of the platform that needs real threads.
//! It is deliberately boring about them: every trial builds its own engine, its
//! own paper sink and its own strategy, and owns all three outright.
