//! One trial: one engine, one strategy, one paper sink, synchronously.
//!
//! A trial is an ordinary function call. It builds everything it needs, runs the
//! synchronous kernel over the shared dataset, reads its own results back and
//! returns them. There is no async in this file and no shared engine: whatever
//! concurrency a sweep runs at, a trial owns its [`Engine`] outright.
//!
//! The wiring, in order:
//!
//! 1. a [`BarFillEngine`] paper sink, wrapped so the trial can read its fills
//!    back once the engine has taken ownership of the runner that holds the
//!    other half of that sink;
//! 2. the strategy, built from the trial's spec and seed;
//! 3. a [`StrategyRunner`] pairing the two, over a fresh ledger;
//! 4. the execution sink registered with the engine *before* the runner, so the
//!    price the runner fills at is the price of the bar being dispatched rather
//!    than the one before it;
//! 5. [`Engine::run`] over a [`DatasetFeed`] reading the shared dataset;
//! 6. metrics over the fills, and the kernel's audit trail, copied verbatim.
