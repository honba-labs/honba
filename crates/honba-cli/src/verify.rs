//! `honba verify` – compile a strategy manifest into its IR (plan.md E0-S8).
//!
//! The CLI reads a JSON file, deserializes it as a `StrategyManifest` (unknown
//! fields rejected: a manifest is an input) and compiles it with
//! `StrategyIr::compile`. On success the IR is printed to stdout as JSON, so an
//! agent or script can pipe it straight into a run; on failure stdout stays
//! empty, stderr carries the stable error code, and the exit code is non-zero.
//! This is the gate that keeps a bad manifest from producing an empty journal
//! that looks like a strategy that did nothing.
